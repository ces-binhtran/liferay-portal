You can obtain the String for example using Azure Portal UI, e.g: 1. via Storage Account -> Access Keys; 2. via Storage Account -> Shared Access Signature; 3. via Storage Account -> Container -> Shared access signature (you must manually build the String based on "Blob SAS URL" and "Blob SAS token"). For all the details, please check azure documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string (Automatic Copy)

You can also raise the log level of 'com.liferay.portal.store.azure' in Control Panel -> System / Server Administration to see more messages from the module's own classes. (Automatic Copy)
